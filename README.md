MatrixDemo
==========

Simple demonstration of matrix manipulations in Java

The Matrix class provides functions to add, multiply, or amplify a given matrix,
or to check if it is a null matrix (all 0's) or unit matrix (all 1's)

(I/O seemed tedious and out of scope for this size a project, but the values in Main.java may be
updated to different values for testing.)

The default values (and the ones baked into the .jar file in /bin) are:

_Amplifier:_ 
2

_Matrix X:_
-	 |1, 2, 3|
-	 |2, 3, 4|
-	 |3, 4, 5|

_Matrix Y:_
-	|2, 2, 2|
-	|1, 3, 1|
-	|1, 2, 3|

_The formula run on these variables:_

(A * X) + Y
